You can move pawns forward by one square by typing the number assigned to the piece or pawn you wanna move, 
the rank you want to move it to (0 to 7), and the file you want to move it to (0 to 7). 0 to 9 are pawns and 10 to 19 are knights.
Please note that the vertical dimension is currently labeled x and to vertical dimension is labeled y, for reasons unknown.
